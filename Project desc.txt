Project Overview:
A web app/ mobile app that helps users track the freshness of fruits and vegetables. In this, users can manually add produce items, specifying item name and purchase date.

Using this the app displays an estimated “best before date” and the time left before that date.

The app would also have recommendation for recipes that could be used with the currently entered produce, it would also show storage tips, like ideal temperature.

Planned Features:
-Manual entry(type + date purchased(quick option for todays date))
-Photo entry
-Barcode entry
-Voice entry

-Freshness Timer / Prediction (Using known shelf life data)
Optionally adjusting based on storage conditions
-Visual countdown and alerts before spoilage
-Recipe section containing recipes that use the already bought produce

-Daily Reminders to notify user when an item is about to go bad
Suggest “use soon” recipes, with an option to exclude stuff like meat, or gluten so that it doesn’t show that to the user if they don’t want that.

-A produce guide section, it shows the average shelf life for common fruits / veggies
-Storage tips in the same place as produce guide and all produce entries.

-Machine Learning image freshness estimation
-???Fridge integration???
-Waste Analytics to show users how much food they are saving.

Tech Stack:
Overall Framework (App): React Native / Next.js for website(maybe)
Image Analysis: TensorFlow Lite / OpenCV / custom ML model (maybe maybe)
Notifications: Local push + calendar integration
Design: Figma
